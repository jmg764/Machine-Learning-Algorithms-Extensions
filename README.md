# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Extensions
This is the final project for the CS-GY-6923 Machine Learning course at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.


## Introduction
The goal of this project is to select three basic machine learning algorithms covered in this course, and explore how they could be improved. We were expected to find an extension of the basic algorithm that is fully implemented by a machine learning library such as scikit-learn or Keras, and then implement this extension from scratch using only NumPy. Each extension is implemented on two different datasets.

The extensions explored in this project are:
1. Neural network with softmax activation function in the output layer (Keras: , Numpy: )
2. Neural network with dropout regularization (Keras: , Numpy: )
3. Support vector machine with soft margin (scikit-learn: , Numpy: )
